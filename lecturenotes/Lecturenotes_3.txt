Visual Mapping - techniques
1 - Color *most common, typically use for the most important factor
2 - Shape
(Arrow glyph ->)
can also double code by making both the color and length express the magnitude of the vector
3 - What else? -> Position / orientation / size
4 - Opacity / transparancy
5 - Texturing 

Color Models:
- RGB - 
- HSV - Cone shaped model

- ex. vector [# # #] <- can express this with RGB or HSV, this is bad, the interpretation is much harder
- ex. if there is a fourth data like magnitude, since magnitude is scaler, it is much easier to represent it with color

color mapping (pseudo-coloring)
1 - "rainbow" color mapping 
2 - gray-scale mappping
