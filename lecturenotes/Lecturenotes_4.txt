Marching cubes
cell defined by four corners
v1 v2 v3 v4 

Bilinear Patch
- interpolate the points, then the lines
- Ptop = v1 + s(v2 - v1)
- Pbot = v4 + s(v3 - v4)
- Psurf = Pbot + t(Ptop - Pbot)

s^2 = (v4 - v1)/(v2 - v1 + v4 - v3)
t^2 = (v4 - v2)/(v2 - v1 + v4 - v3)

Resampling:
trilinear interpolation

Sparse Data Interpolation: needed for prog 1:
Shepard's Interpolation:
- inverse distance based idea
- function of location: f(x,y) = ?
- Fj => measurement
- dj => distance from Fj to xy
- calculte weight and stuff
- shepard's is really general, it works for any-D data 2-D 3-D 4-D ... same thing
- add more variables corresponding to the dimensionality, the form still stays the same
- Shepard's can be applied to scalar and vector values
- problem of shepards - temperature - smoothly change good, can't assume the same for all kind of data
- issues with shepards - Mathematically its fine but physically
