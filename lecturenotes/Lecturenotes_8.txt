CMPS 161 notes alepan's anecdotes of research days feelsgoodman 

- create system of doing environmental science 
- visualization of environmental datasets 
- in the early 90s, internet was relatively new 
- get data into databases, need to provide an interface to access the database 
- REINAS - spanish:queen - Realtime environmental blah blah 
- their approach, users not familiar with tech, need to make interface that they can get educated 
- created a vis, so that it look exactly what they are used to, 2D vis 
- artificial, but if move the mouse, it can rotate, its actually 3D, can show volume information rather 
than just a slice 
- if working with people in the medical field, they really consider accuracy 
- some guys didn't want to use computers, need to make a metaphor 
- define 3 classes of users - forecasters, scientist, recreational users 
- forecaster, vis that is customized for information that they want, pressure maps, etc. 
- scientist - want to understand the data, regular data, but also simulation data 
- data simulation - initial condition(need to update), run similation, update or pretty soon its going to divert from reality 
- scientist - had to create some kind of metaphor for them 
- recreational - commertial users - just want the information 

- scientist - what metaphor - imagine the database is right in front of you, but it is invisable, 
need to paint it to make it visable, the color corresponds to the different kind of vis 
- spray rendering - partical spraying is called smart particles, spraying these smart particles into data 
depending on te data it hits, it performs differently, dust particles are sent to data space 
shoot out a bunch of particles, make this data volume visable by coloring it 

- generalize the idea of smart particle - target can be particular data value  [small set of targets]
- behaviour when encounter data [fairly small size of behaviours]
- update position  [what does this particle do next]
- termination condition - die/birth generated where the point of the spray can is 

Using this construction, how can we define smart particles to represent visualizations that look like isosurfaces? 

How do we do streamlines with this technique?
- target - wherever you end of being - seed point 
- behaviour - simply connect the previous position with the current position with a line segment 
- update - integration - can integrate it if the line is getting shorter and shorter, or stop and vise-versa 

- how do we represent uncertainty?
- std deviation 	#
- range 			# #
- conflicting data(alternative facts lel) 	# # ... # or can be just guessing 

simplist case: standard deviation 

heatmap -> rbg ALPHA 
contours 
iso surfaces
