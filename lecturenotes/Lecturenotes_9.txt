CMPS 161 Lecture Notes 9

Prog2: 
- streamgraph - take that streamgraph, based on zero line, and turn it into a circle 
- problem: if want to make it into a circle, there is going to be some kind of discontinuity 
- it might not be ideal beacauce of that 
- sampling - connecting two points with a line has an indication 
- would it make sense to extrapolate the line to predict the next position? 
- when drawing the lines, we are assuming that is right to do 
- when might be missing the information/trend inbetween the lines 
- we can make a linear assumption, but needs to be careful *stiching 
- streamlines do that between every points? 
- talk about how to do in lab, akaash help plz 
- corona - squiggly line around circle in nutshell -+
- also inside the circle as well 
- circular streamgraph display 
- stacking streamgraphs? regular corona has circle in the middle, do not touch the base line(straight) 
- display first cycle, display second cycle by adding another cycle on top of first one - option 
- use some time into 
- everything start from zero and depending on the data you can change up and stuff I think feelskindaconfusedman

Lecture: 
- infovis data 
- Multivariate data:
- star plot/ rose diagram 
- chernoff faces 
- Parallel coordinates allows you to show relation between glphys - might look like a mess but may see some habits 

Techniques:
- statistical 
- layout 
- distortion 
- interaction
