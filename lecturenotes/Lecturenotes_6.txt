CMPS 161 Lecture Notes 6

Flow Visualization:
- streamlines- every tangent to the flow 
- that arrow means tangent to the flow of the point 
- connect these plot that maintain this definition 
- how do we make this operation?
- v = ds/dt - need to integrate 
- s = INTEGRAL(V dt)
- integrating forward in time, can also integrate going backward in time from starting point 

Euler Integration: (1st order)
- P_kh = P_k + h * V * (P_k)
- h = integration step size 
- if trying to animate a swinging pendulum - also doing Euler integration 
- use more information to predict where to be next 

2nd order integration :
- P_kh = P_k + h * V * (  P_k + h/2 * v(P_k))

4th order: Runge-katta (RK4)
- P_kh = P_k + 1/6 * (K_1 + 2K_2 + 2K_3 + K_4)
- K_1 = h * V * (P_k)
- K_2 = h * V * (P_k + K_1 / 2) 
- K_3 = h * V * (P_k + K_2 / 2)
- k_4 = h * V * (P_k + K_3)
- at least 4 times more expensive 
- main integration algorthim for doing flow
