CMPS 161 lecture notes

When data reaches to a certain point, you need visualization.
When data is too sparse, there are some other obvious problems

First prog: deals with case with too little data and still need to visualize it.

Main ideas: 
- gain insight - perception and cognition 
- make decisions
- convey specific messages

we mainly use perception, cognition is more on the realm of psycology.

natural spacial mapping

Spatial -> scientific visualization
just a classfication of techniques

Non-spacial -> abstract data -> infovis visualization

Visualization if only one way to map data:
Sonification (map data to sound), and other ways the present datas
Think about subliminal messages

ultimate goal is to gain insight on data by visualizing it.


Scientific Visualization:
- relatively young field 1987 - 89
- came from things like medical images
- CFD computational flow dynamics
- CAD/CAM
- manufacturing

During that time, x-ray was common, CAT-SCAN was new

Side track: RayTracing:
shoot a ray for each pixel to display
CAT-SCAN get 3d scaler volume of bones -> question is how to visualize it

CFD computational flow dynamic:
- design of air flow, aerodynamics
- plate techtonics, anything that moves can be modeled using CFD

Dimension space/time
0D(one point),1D, 2D, 3D, T

Degree
Scaler, vecor, tensor

Dimension vs Degree, classify datasets and visualize them accordingly
Ex. 2d & vector -> specific visualization of 2d vector

Space orginization:
- can be organized as a grid
- can also be unstructured -> deal with abstract data sets


0D: point wise data set:
- just one data, 68degree
- color -> where to put this red? -> need a shape
- just write 68 - actually very good visualization, done, no confusion

Lets say in this Eng 2 building with 50 rooms with different temperature.
-> How would you visualize it?
- visualize as a cube divided with boxes
- map temperature as color -> temperature corresponds to the rgb value of the room
- problems with design? -> can't see inside if filled with full color, even if ray traced it would have mized color
- depends on what kind of anwser you want from the infovis

Scaler, Vector, Tensor
#, [#, #, ...], velocity

2dVector
Vx, Vy
direction, magnitude

Generally, you get data from different discipline, so you need to learn it and present it in the same way

Glyph vs icon: 
- Glyph retains the shape but changes depending on certain data changes
- plate techtonics, tensor glyphs

0D -> glpyhs

[GPA, GREv, GREq, GREa, RI, R/NR]
The pentagon yawarakaatamajuku/persona/jiisan thing (apparently called starplat)
Chernoff faces
Depending on the placment, might change the emphasis on the data


Prog 1:
Generate velocity fields
