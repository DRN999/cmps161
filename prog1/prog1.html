		<p>This is my attempt at programming assignment 1. It is very, very imcomplete</p>
		<p>I wasn't able to understand the problem, where I yet to understand what I am suppose to do with 
		the resolution data and how I am suppose the design my data structure using that data.</p>
		<p>To my understanding, I think I am responsible for setting up how large the grid is going to up to me, and I 
		set up the cells inside this fixed size structure that fits for all the data_#number_.txt</p>
		<p>then use shepard's interpolation (inverse distance weighting interpolation) where the closer the cell is to 
		the points, the closer the values are as well.</p>
